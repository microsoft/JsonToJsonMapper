#Please note we are also targeting base json library in .net core going forward
# JsonToJsonMapper 

AutoMapper works on JSON format to exchange information between systems. It enables transformation of data from one canonical schema to another and allows integration of different SaaS applications through orchestration. 
Following are some of the capabilities that Automapper currently supports:
1. Transformation from a flat type to flat/complex type.
2. Transformation from a complex type to flat/complex type.
3. Allows execution of CSharp script through Roslyn for complex transformation.
4. Supports JArray
5. Supports transformation of values from one datatype to another.
6. Data type validation

## Following are the handlers currently supported by the tool

**Transpose**
1. Key
2. Value
3. PrependText

**Type converter**
1. Primitive data types
2. JObject
3. JArray
4. DateTime Formatting and Timezone
5. Nullable int, guid and decimal

**Roslyn Script**
1. Script
2. Params
3. Execution

**Value Mapping**
1. Params

**Function Handler**
1. Concatenation
2. Replace value
3. Split 
4. ToUpper
5. ToLower

### Example
Source Json
```json
{
  "result": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "leadId": 6,
      "activityDate": "2013-09-26T06:56:35+0000",
      "activityTypeId": 12,
      "attributes": [
        {
          "name": "Source Type",
          "value": "Web page visit"
        },
        {
          "name": "Source Info",
          "value": "https://www.bing.com/"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Expected output
```json
{
  "Content": [
    {
      "leadId": 6,
      "Source Type": "Web page visit",
      "Source Info": "https://www.bing.com/"
    }
  ]
}
```

Mapping config
```json
{
  "MappingRuleConfig": {
      "TruthTable": [
          {
              "DestinationColumn": "ContentJSON",
              "ComplexType": {
                  "DataType": "JArray",
                  "Node": "$.result[*]",
                  "TruthTable": [
                  {
                       "SourceColumn": "$.leadId",
                       "DestinationColumn": "leadId",
                       "DataType": "long"
                   },
                   {
                       "SourceColumn": "$.attributes[*]",
                       "DataType": "JArray",
                       "TransformValue": {
                             "Type": "PromoteArrayToProperty",
                             "KeyLookupField": "$.name",
                             "ValueLookupField": "$.value"
                              }
                   }
               ]
